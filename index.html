<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
<div class="box">
  <p>I came to coding very recently. I began casually inspecting webpages code, then shortly after became obsessed with watching David Malan's CS50 lectures at Harvard, even tackling some of the problem sets for that course (all in C). At that point, the allure of solving problems with a type of "language" was my real interest. Since 2012, I've worked as an assistant Adjunct Professor of Foundations and Painting, a small business owner, and a practicing artist. All three of these occupations require first, an understanding of the possibilities of the tools at hand, and then finding the various solutions inside of that structure. This is all critical thinking and creative problem solving. This keeps me going.<p>

<h2><em>My Background</em></h2>
<div class="box">
  <p>I was born in Portland Oregon in 1978. My father, now deceased, made his living as a small business owner and jazz musician. My mother, to this day is the principal Harpist in the Oregon Symphony, in Portland, OR. My household was musical, and early on I studied music, but later took a keen interest in visual arts, which I pursued as an Undergraduate at University of Oregon, where I received my BFA Painting degree in 2003. I later went on to receive an MFA degree at the Tyler Shcool of Art in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
<div class="box">
  <p>I'm naturally a very curious person, and it leads me to have many hobbies, but here is a list of just a few:</p>

<div class="list-2">
<h3><em>Links to Github---</em></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mgcraig78/Vacation"><strong>Vacation</strong><em>- This is a page using HTML, but also featuring some very cool features of Bootstrap.</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mgcraig78/Animal_Shelter"><strong>Animal Shelter</strong><em>- This is a page showing some bootstrap elements.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mgcraig78/Media-Queries"><strong>Media Queries</strong><em>- This is a basic HTML page that employs media queries to adjust the content based on screen size.</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mgcraig78/divs-spans-etc"><strong>Divs, Spans, Trash</strong><em>- This is a random site that I put together and I really enjoy it. So I got this keen idea to combine all aspects of a day of Epicodus into one page, as opposed to many, which each display only one or two facets of web development. This page uses divs, spans, floats, and the box model. Side note, I lived in Philly for a decade and was surrounded by trash.</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mgcraig78/Edited-Cookie-Recipe"><strong>Cookie Recipe</strong><em>- Very basic html page from day 1 at Epicodus.</em></a></li>
  </ul>
