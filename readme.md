# Portfolio of Work

#### This is a landing page for my work, May, 2020

#### By _**Matthew Craig**_

## Description

_This page serves as an online gateway into some current projects that I've worked on this past year._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Access to a computer or tablet/smartphone_
* _Internet connection_
* _Browser software_
* _A mouse or trackpad (if using a computer)_

_For an initial look, if the above requirements are met, you can view the pages code through the github repositories. For a more in depth look, you may need to install a code editing tool such as visual studio code or atom. Once that code editing software is installed, you may download the repository and open the html file, and it will open in your default browser as it would look when published to the web. It should be noted that this tactic is untested on smartphones and tablets._
